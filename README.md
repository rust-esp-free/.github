# Rust ESP
RUST ESP can offer a handful of advantages that can take your gameplay to the next level, and this is why most new players are tempted to use cheat tools initially. However, in the long run, it can completely disrupt the balance in gameplay, distort fairness, and discourage honest players who use their skills and abilities to win instead of cheat tools.

## What Is RUST ESP?
In gaming, ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) refers to a cheat tool that reveals normally hidden information about resources, opponents, and the environment to give the player an advantage.

You can access hidden information about player names, enemy positions, their weapons and health status, loot, animals, traps, and resources. In fact, you can even spot enemies through solid objects like walls and obstacles even before they appear. This can help you anticipate enemy movements, avoid ambushes, and tactically plan attacks in advance.

RUST ESP can completely change your gameplay and make you more efficient, without being limited by your own skills and instincts. Overall, the cheat tool increases your awareness of the environment and helps you react faster.
## How the ESP Cheat is Used in RUST
Once RUST ESP is activated, the cheat runs in the background as you play the game. It constantly overlays live data on your screen. You can access visible information about enemy positions, their distance, health status, and weapons, even when they are hiding. ESP is a major advantage.
